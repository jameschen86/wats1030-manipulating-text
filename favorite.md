Out of all three editors Vi or Vim gave me the most "error" ping. But once you get how to switch modes between "esc" and "i" it became kind of easy. Granted the command lines were a pain in the butt to find, and you don't really get any tips on what you did wrong. In the end I took a liking to Vi and will continue to use it in the future. Call it twisted but I tend to like things that make my life unnessary complicated.
